# TASK 1 : LANDING PAGE 
A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. It requires a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. In this project, you will learn how to:

- Add columns and divide sections
- Arrange items and create headers and footers
- Use your creativity to design an impressive page

Attention to detail is key. Pay close attention to alignment, padding, color palettes, and boxes. Ensure that your CSS skills are on point to avoid any overlapping elements.
